    "reviews": "I love these shoes but I'll probably end up putting in-soles because I have high arches. It's amazing how incredibly fast the order came though. My shoe size can range from a woman's 6, 6.5, or 7 depending on the brand. I bought a woman's size 6.5 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-top and it fits perfectly. I'll definitely be shopping at Zappos more! I'd also recommend: Alice+Olivia Keds",
